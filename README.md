The aim was to model the Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at different Constant Maturity Time Periods, specifically, 1-Year, 2-Year, 3-Year, 5-Year, 7-Year, and 10-Year returns. The additional task was to try and reduce dimensions of the combined data set, while still explaining most of the variation.
